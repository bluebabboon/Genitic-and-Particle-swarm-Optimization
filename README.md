# Genitic-and-Particle-swarm-Optimization
A new algorithm which uses Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm and Non dominated sorting particle swarm optimization to evaluate Job sequence in Machine shop 

It gives optimal solution for 
Minimizing Penalty costs for not performing an operation or job 
Minimizing Unbalance(Idle time for a machine)
Maximizing Throughput(Output of jobs per unit time)
All considered at same time using Non dominated sorting techniques (More info - https://www.iitk.ac.in/kangal/Deb_NSGA-II.pdf )

This algorithm is an ensemble of Genetic and Particle swarm optimization which pass population information from one to another
to get optimal solution.

Refer PPT for more details.
